## Description

The purpose of this portfolio was to utilize our skills with HTML and advanced Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) in order to show a future employer our skills as web developers.  As well as including examples of previous work, a potential employer could use the actual portfolio webpage itself, to assess our skills with CSS.  The objective was to make a dynamic and interactive portfolio page that moved the user to where they desired based on a click of the cursor.  Furthermore, the webpage changes based on screen size, making it more accessible to the user on small tablets.
